      Periodically check PUBLIC ES domains that have
      access policies that are too permissive.
      Ignore PRIVATE ES domains.
      PRIVATE domains will have VPCOptions configured.
      PUBLIC  domains will have a Condition with AccessApolicies configured.
      Send email/Slack notification.
