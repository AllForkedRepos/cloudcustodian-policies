      Cloud Custodian EBS AutoCleanup Tag
    comments: |
      Tags ebs volume with name "AutoCleanup" and sets value to "false"
      unless volume is already tagged with "true".
      This policy is used with the ebs-garbage-collection policy
      which periodically checks ebs volumes with the "AutoClenaup"
      tag set to "true" to mark ebs volumes for deletion after 24 hours
      of being in the state "available".
