      Retrieve list of all resources that match tag
      Note, ec2 is used as an example, but any resource that supports tags
      can be used. Simply replace the resource with the appropriate name.
      For example, replace ec2 with security-group if you want to filter
      against tagged security groups.
    filters:
      - "tag:Team": absent
      - type: value
        key: "tag:Owner"
        value: (.*mike\.garrison|.*amir\.kibbar|.*jon\.voigt|.*chris\.varnerin|.*nikos\.michalakis)
        op: regex
#    actions:
#      - type: tag
#        key: "Team"
#        value: "Cloud"
